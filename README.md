### Hi there 👋
- 🖥️ I'm an experienced software engineer/architect who's pivoted towards AppSec, DevSecOps, SecEng, Cloud Native Security, etc.
- 🎓 Moving into security, I completed a B.S., IT - Cybersecurity and Information Assurance at Western Governors University in 2021.
- 🔭 I’ve come up several potential cool projects for this portfolio in the following lanauges: Golang, Python, Ruby, Rust, C/C++, NodeJS, (maybe) Java, and some others as I have time.
- 📰 As of 2023, I've been mostly working learning Golang so something of that nature should be the next project that I write.
- 💬 Can be found on many platforms as: vect0rx
