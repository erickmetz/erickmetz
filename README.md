### Hi there 👋
- 🖥️ I'm an experienced software engineer/architect who's pivoted towards Security Engineering (AppSec, DevSecOps, Cloud Native Security, etc).
- 🎓 Moving into security, I completed a B.S., IT - Cybersecurity and Information Assurance at Western Governors University in 2021.
- 🔭 I’ve come up several potential cool projects for this portfolio in the following lanauges: Golang, Python, Ruby, Rust, C/C++, NodeJS, maybe Java, and some others as I have time.
- 🐢 Looking back, this has been slow-going BUT I've been writing a ton of Golang at the gig. So next non-Python thing will likely be some kind of go app or package.
- 💬 Can be found on many platforms as: vect0rx
