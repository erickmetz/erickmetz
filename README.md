### Hi there 👋
- 🖥️ I'm an experienced software engineer/architect pivoting towards AppSec, DevSecOps, SecEng, Cloud Solutions, etc...
- 🎓 I’m currently wrapping up a bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance at Western Governors University.
- 🤔 I’m looking to get a little more formally into the security side of the tech industry pretty quick after I graduate here.
- 🌱 I’m currently doing a 100 Days of Code python course on Udemy to de-rust myself a bit on coding as well.
- 🔭 I’m planning on adding some projects that will be somewhat interesting in the following lanauges: 
C/C++, Python, Ruby, Rust, NodeJS, Java, and some others as I have time.
